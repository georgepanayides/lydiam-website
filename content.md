LYDIAM GROUP – BROCHURE CONSOLIDATION & EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
CORE POSITIONING (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Lydiam positioned as:
An institutional-grade, one-stop financial platform for corporates, HNWIs, family offices, professionals, and institutions - combining named bank accounts, FX, crypto, payments, advisory, and partner-led execution under a single onboarding and relationship.
Think:
“A more powerful, institutional version of Revolut - with advisory, structure, and global reach.”
This positioning must be reinforced on every page, either explicitly or implicitly.

1. WHAT TO KEEP FROM THE OLD BROCHURE
The following elements from the old brochure are strong and should be reused, refined, or visually repurposed:
KEEP & REUSE (with refinement)
✅ A. Multi-Currency Account Explanation
The concept explaining what a multi-currency account is works well for non-technical readers.
Reframe it as Named IBAN / Virtual IBAN Accounts in the client’s own name.
Use plain language, not banking jargon.
👉 Keep the explainer concept, rewrite the copy.
✅ B. Crypto On-Ramp / Off-Ramp Diagram
The visual explaining fiat → crypto → fiat is excellent.
Keep the diagram style.
Update wording to:
“Structured & compliant access”
“Institutional liquidity”
Avoid “no banking restrictions” language
👉 Keep visual, refine copy.
✅ C. “How It Works” Step-by-Step (1-2-3)
The simple onboarding / transact / operate flow is very effective.
Use this format for:
FX & payments
Crypto
Getting started
👉 Keep the format, apply it consistently.
✅ D. FX Risk Management Use Case
The real-world FX example adds credibility.
Keep one use case only (don’t overload).
Optional: add one payments / treasury use case later if space allows.
👉 Keep one use case only.
✅ E. Security / Trust Page Layout
This page looks clean, institutional, and bank-friendly.
Use this visual style as a template for:
Security & compliance
Global coverage & currencies
👉 Keep the design language.
2. REMOVE ENTIRELY
Any pricing / fee tables
Duplicate green divider pages that only show a title with no content.
Add when comes to compliance -  “Efficient, risk-based onboarding aligned with institutional standards.”
